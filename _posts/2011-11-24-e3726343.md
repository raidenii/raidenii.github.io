Previously Rufus' guide about running WfW 3.11 on QEMU (link is dead) suggested that with Qemu 0.9.1 it is possible to run WfW with 1024x768x16.8M colors. However, I never get Qemu 0.9.1 running on my Win7 x64 SP1, so I gave up and used Qemu 0.14.0 instead, thus cannot use the highest resolution available. But later when I accessed [this webpage](http://www.os-museum.com/emuwindows31/emuwindows31.htm) (in Japanese) it says:

> QEMU on Windows 0.9.1(qemu-0.9.1-windows.zip：2008年2月3日ビルド版)はWindows 7 RCでは利用できません。
>
> QEMU on Windows 0.9.1ベースの2008年12月29日ビルド版(qemu-20081229-windows.zip)はWindows 7 RCで動作します。

Basically it means that the version compiled on 02/03/2008 (which is the most common version) cannot run on Win7 RC but the one built on 12/29/2008 can. Thus I googled it and tried - it indeed works! I downloaded it from here: [http://moinmoin.in/w/Pub/Qemu](http://moinmoin.in/w/Pub/Qemu) The video driver I used is from Cluania: [http://www.claunia.com/qemu/drivers/win\_5446.zip](http://www.claunia.com/qemu/drivers/win_5446.zip)

Note that this driver will NOT work with 800x600x16.8M, but it works fine with either 800x600x64K or 1024x768x16.8M.

Another IMPORTANT note about display: When using WinMode to setup resolution rate, remember to change to amount of font cache size to **0kb** , otherwise you'll get corrupted fonts. For monitor settings I tried both PC brand and Other brand, seems working fine in either case.
